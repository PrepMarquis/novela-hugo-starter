Life has subtle ways to make you think about your character that you wouldn't do otherwise, normally.

I like a certain American tradition, they make teenagers to work at service level jobs to make them learn about life and make a few bucks on the side. We don't have that in my country though it would be better if we did. Until you get a service level job and exchange with people who are not your friends nor family, without a leverage you understand that you wouldn't want to be known and approached by anyone.

I did my service at a non-profit I helped founding. (ironic!) late it was, but I have learned to spot red flags and this is a post to remind me of them everywhere I go from now.
