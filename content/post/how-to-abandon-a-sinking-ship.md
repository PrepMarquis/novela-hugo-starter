Life has subtle ways to make you think about your character that you wouldn't do otherwise, normally.

Hoops I've jumped through so far taught me to appreciate opportunity, embrace and grow towards it. Though there is no solid education to spot false-opportunity especially when you are young, clueless in a similarly clueless and hopeless job market.

I like a certain American tradition, they make teenagers to work at service level jobs to make them learn about life and make a few bucks on the side. We don't have that in my country though it would be better if we did. Until you get a service level job and exchange with people who are not your friends or family nor equals, you understand that you wouldn't want to be known and approached by anyone and everyone. You better find your tribe from the crowd and stick to them.

I did my service at a non-profit I helped founding. (ironic!) late it was, but I have learned to spot red flags and this is a post to remind me of them everywhere I go from now.

* There are no clear goals
* Organization resist to form any structure
* Job descriptions are not clear
* They fail to recognize key employees
* They do not suit your work style

  This, I don't have a solid theory to quote. Though thorugh exprience I certainly came to believe everyone has some sort of work style that can be categorized generally made up  by what communication means to a person.
