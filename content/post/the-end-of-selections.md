#### We live in a world of rejection letters, poor grades, disillusioning resumes and that cold silence after you hit send.

But hey! Maybe an automated reply bot would catch your message to follow-up on you. Then proceed to send you latest updates from the company/school/program you applied for. Who knows?

It is pretty much evident that our world is a one piece of solid competition over scarce resources. 

This is why we @ [uretkenakademi.com](https://uretkenakademi.com) were running a fully online incubator program for founders and entrepreneurs before it was cool! Being online helps you scale and distribute your impact at a percent of you would have beared in a full face2face setting.

Most importantly, we believe that in our day and age we should not seek for people who can deliver you knowledge at demand, But rather turn it into a system.
