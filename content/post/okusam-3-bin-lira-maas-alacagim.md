**I really wanted to write this in Turkish.** It is more appropriate for the context, really what hurts me more is to see my ability to write coherent pieces in Turkish has somewhat detoriated. Probaly due to practical usage I rarely ever use it to convey anything meaninful or throughly researched anymore.

Gözümün önünde her gün olup biten olayları gerçekten fark etmem ve aksiyon almam için birilerinin çizdiği gelecek portresini görmem gerekir.

Before you spend time on my take, please take a step back to look at two other wonderful writeups that encouraged me to produce mine. I just presented an established problem from my own POV, nothing more.

[First](https://twitter.com/mrozansonmez/status/1354068332991885315) article

Once there was a notion of "American Dream" on the land of free anyone could make it. It had a nation building aspect whether you consider the conquering the west of the states for the first time or a 1950's home in the suburbs: a car, wife, kids, picket fences and drive-ins. All of these gave the middle class (or the rising middle class) a reason to strive for the whatever small scraps on the table after corporate and politics did their thing.

A similar thing once presented itself. Let's call it "Turkish Dream" for similarity.

It wasn't for anyone or everyone, latter was catered towards an established base of strivers: a so called middle class that obtained their status via education.

The new state didn't need a dream for everyone

Funnel was simple enough: start in a city -> get a good elementary education from a gov school -> sit in highschool entrance exams -> get a good secondary education from a gov highscool  (get to know your fellow prospective middle classers as well) -> sit in university enterance exams and perform exceptionally well -> get a good job and a stable career where you can practive the lifestyle of Turkish white collar middle class.

That funnel is... well... kinda broken these days.

If I can be candid with you. I am the product of that belief system as well everything I did, ganied as a skill paraded as my success was about that thing, that notion about filling up my resume with random garbage just to get in a 8to5 job with 4000₺ attached in the end. Because everybody is doing it. Right?

For anyone still pursing this fruitless, lifeless, remorseful life path. A relic from 2000's. I can only hope that you can see the light at the end of the tunnel somewhere. Everybody is messing with you and you are still keen to attend another useless career fair, another certificate program that nobody cares.

Hey you!

Stop applying for that useless internship and get something better to do with your time.
