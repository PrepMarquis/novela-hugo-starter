**I really wanted to write this in Turkish.** Before everything it is more appropriate for the context, really what hurts me more is to see my ability to write coherent pieces in Turkish has somewhat detoriated. Probaly due to practical usage of it. I rarely ever use it to convey anything meaninful or throughly researched anymore.

Though what I have a hard time with is to see everyday things, when mounted on top of one another, creating bigger problems and distrupting systems in the process. I generally have to have an outsider paint me a picture to understand.

Before you spend time on my take, please take a step back to look at two other wonderful writeups that encouraged me to produce mine. I just presented an established problem from my own POV, nothing more.

[First](https://twitter.com/mrozansonmez/status/1354068332991885315) article

[Second](https://www.paraanaliz.com/2020/ekonomi/kerim-rota-yazdi-baris-ve-sinemin-orta-direk-olma-hayali-50957/) article (somewhat more relevant)

Once there was a notion of "American Dream" on the land of free: anyone could make it. It had a nation building aspect whether you consider the conquering the west of the states for the first time or a 1950's home in the suburbs: a car, wife, kids, picket fences and drive-ins. All of these gave the middle class (or the rising middle class) a reason to strive for the whatever small scraps left on the table after corporate and politics did their thing. Middle class can be easier to motivate though. They rarely need external help (they buy motivation books and listen to that crap 7/24) and keen to accept the blame when a rich person tells them you are simply not good enough. They also rarely get organized, something that is unique to them I suppose. That may or not be situational, when you look at it holistically a group of political or monetary hustlers can pull off an organizational attempt better than a bunch of whatever "exceptional" college grads with clear cut job titles, hundreds of hours chasing after crappy cardboard furniture from IKEA and an entry level Mercedes.

A similar thing once presented itself. Let's call it "Turkish Dream" for similarity.

It wasn't for anyone or everyone, latter was catered towards an established base of strivers: a so called middle class that obtained their status via education.

The new state didn't need a dream for everyone

Funnel was simple enough: start in a city -> get a good elementary education from a gov school -> sit in highschool entrance exams -> get a good secondary education from a gov highscool*  (get to know your fellow prospective middle classers as well) -> sit in university enterance exams and perform exceptionally well** -> get a good job and a stable career where you can practive the lifestyle of Turkish white collar middle class.

* * (reads whatever science or anatolian highscool is available to you.)
* ** (reads the self proclaimed top 5 universities in Turkey, you know what I am talking about)

That funnel is... well... kinda broken these days.

If I can be candid with you. I am the product of that belief system as well everything I did, ganied as a skill paraded as my success was about that thing, that notion about filling up my resume with random garbage just to get in a 8to5 job with 4000₺ attached in the end. Because everybody is doing it. Right?

Why the Z generation then... Unimpressed, unmotivated to work and changes jobs like underwear. Hear it from me.

##### They scammed our parents too.

Can you expect otherwise when somebody hears nothing but selfishness, extra unpaid and demanding work hours, unwilling neglect and dead-end career paths when their parents from private sector talks about their job? You bet.

##### The jobs are: unimaginative, repetitive and condescending.

At my university, we do these big name top shelf career fairs where we supposed to meet recruiters. What is surprising about that is interviews, job processes presented from every year that progresses are moving towards to becoming a total practical joke.

Everybody has their objections aboyut the generation Z. The best things are missed so far. This is a generation of entrepreneurs, husters, social changers and [volunteers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesnonprofitcouncil/2018/11/09/gen-z-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-newest-generation-of-donors-and-volunteers/?sh=62103bb92fd6). Who do not need  someone with authority-by-maturity to boss them around on something so unremarkable.

##### Do we have a future after all?

So, you know people from certain backgrounds tend to collect and hoard value that is easier to carry and exchange. Those of whom generally are oppressed, displaced or not welcomed with a warm smile to feel comfortable for a big balls investment in the countries they live in. They never that that trust level (think of Nazi Germany)

It is really interesting to see a whole arsenal of top holdings and firms baffled on the sight of this realm. **People doesn't think they have a future for crying out loud.** Working for you or any of that kind is an investment, and what'd be the return? Oh yes, enough monthly income to rent a dungeon in big cities. What is it more you want? 

For anyone still pursing this fruitless, lifeless, remorseful life path. A relic from 2000's. I can only hope that you can see the light at the end of the tunnel somewhere. Everybody is messing with you and you are still keen to attend another useless career fair, another certificate program that nobody cares.

Hey you!

Stop applying for that useless internship and get something better to do with your time.
