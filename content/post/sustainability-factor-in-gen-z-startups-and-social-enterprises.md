### Gotta love the classic-classification of generations! It's everywhere.

Yeah I totally get it by now. And chances are you do too. Gen X, Y and Z play or have played different roles in their respective stages of life. Z'ers differ slightly from Y by greater and somethat "**native"** tech exposure in their upbringing. Their parent's relationship with money allegedly believed to take a toll in their way of spending and saving habits. And there is this **experience** vs **savings** claim which I don't really think it's something really stands out as an argument. What makes us think Z'ers would make a great homo-economicuses when they don't really have a financial track record yet? Is an entirely a different thing for discussion which is not ultimately a part of this piece.

[Here is an extensive report on that matter](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/meet-generation-z-the-newest-member-to-the-workforce/). Also don't forget to check out Visual Capitalist every once in a while.

I have been working exclusively with young entrepreneurs and founders since the spring of 2018 @ [uretkenakademi.com](https://uretkenakademi.com) we run a fully online incubator program targeted exclusively to solve preexisting problems at certain vertical sectors. So you don't actually worry about thinking on product-market fit. While you should be working on your **actual product**.

Anyways, from the moment I set my mind up to become an entrepreneur. I'd spend times to get to know young entrepreneurs in the ecosystem. 

It is typical that with the surge of internet usage among young people, we consider working in small, independent projects more than ever
