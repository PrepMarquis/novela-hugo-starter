### Gotta love the classic classification of generations! It's everywhere.

[Here is an extensive report on that matter](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/meet-generation-z-the-newest-member-to-the-workforce/). Don't forget to check out Visual Capitalist every once in a while.

I have been working exclusively with young entrepreneurs and founders since the spring of 2018 @ [uretkenakademi.com](https://uretkenakademi.com) we run a fully online incubator program targeted exclusively to solve preexisting problems at certain vertical sectors. So you don't actually worry about thinking on product-market fit. While you should be working on your **actual product**.

Anyways, from the moment I set my mind up to become an entrepreneur. I'd spend times to get to know young entrepreneurs in the ecosystem.
