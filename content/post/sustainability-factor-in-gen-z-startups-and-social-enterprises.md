### Gotta love the classic-classification of generations! It's everywhere.

Yeah I totally get it by now. And chances are, you do too. Gen X, Y and Z play or have played different roles in their respective stages of life. Z'ers differ slightly from Y by greater and somethat "**native"** tech exposure in their upbringing. Their parent's relationship with money allegedly believed to take a toll in their way of spending and saving habits. And there is this **experience** vs **savings** claim which I don't really think it's something really stands out as an argument. What makes us think Z'ers would make a great homo-economicuses when they don't really have a financial track record yet? Is an entirely a different thing for discussion which is not ultimately a part of this piece.

[Here is an extensive report on that matter](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/meet-generation-z-the-newest-member-to-the-workforce/). Also don't forget to check out Visual Capitalist every once in a while.

I have been working exclusively with young entrepreneurs and founders since the spring of 2018 as COO @ [uretkenakademi.com](https://uretkenakademi.com) we run a fully online incubator program targeted exclusively to solve preexisting problems at certain vertical sectors. So you don't actually worry about thinking on product-market fit. While you should be working on your **actual product**.

Anyways, from the moment I set my mind up to become an entrepreneur. (_circa 2017_) I'd spend times to get to know young entrepreneurs in the ecosystem. What they do and what is that with their background so that they carried themselves (or carried by others) to actually launch a product in such early ages. Often times this age scale drops to 14-15 even into the first years of middle school if we look at the individual small projects and recognize them as an "_initiative_" some others were doing all sorts of things while in high school or in early college.

It is typical that with the surge of internet usage among young people, we consider working in small, independent projects more than ever. Digital hustles have lower entry tresholds, most of the resources and guides to launch an MVP are free. And with the startup bloom in the recent 4 years conventional education facilities really giving tech education a push for youngsters completing their secondary education. Some traditionalist education structures consider early entrepreneurship as a significant boost in Z'ers resume in Turkey (my ecosystem) or in USA and Europe alike.

Let's have a look at a standart Z'er startup shall we? Most probably we'd find a mobile app made exclusively redundant in modern aesthetics and about a similarly hip subject such as a fitness tracker or a learning companion. You'd find tons of alternatives to that template take a look at producthunt there are tons of Z'er made apps sprawling around. Many of them are maintained singlehandedly with a tech savvy founder or a bunch of tech savvy people from different focuses.

And we have our non-profit, we'd have a leader who'd form a triangle shaped management structure and singlehandedly sets the vision goals and metrics etc. Trying to recruit savvy people into the cause faster than they lose interest.

While the coating is different let's look at what's inside underneath.

##### These are the general problems of all of these Z'er run programs.

* Most of the work done in Gen-Z startups are **pro-bono**, it hurts the ownership and continuity.
* There is generally little effort ensuring **efficiency in for-profit** or **accountability in non-profits**.
* Some people are doing it because it is somewhat cool
* Gen-Z entrepreneurs and founders work in cycles.
* With little to no formal education or experience on management, Z'ers often form initiatives around a **halo-effect-leader**.

#### Most of the work done in Gen-Z startups are **pro-bono**, it hurts the ownership and continuity.

So when we discuss ownership and sustainability in Z'er startups we generally mean lack of **formal structures** such as legal entities like businesses and employment records, paper trails etc. While there are very exceptional compaines in that matter such as [JUV](https://juvconsulting.com) your ordinary Z'er startup wouldn't have a formal structure because guess what in most of the jurisdictions they are not old enough to form the entity yet! Or the paperwork is another cost-bearing side of things or they just don't register **formal structures** as a priority. They are **digital natives** after all(!) who needs to be swarmed with adult busy work.

Although, if you run a Z'er company or a collective who call themselves a "**company**" it's always better to regard your team's work. Form a structure around the problems of ownership who does the work and outcomes belongs to whom? Could it be the main reasons that Z'er startups disappear as fast as they grew out of nowhere?
