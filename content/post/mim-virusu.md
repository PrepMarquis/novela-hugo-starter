There is a breakthrough in the field of NLP. Despite of its familliarity with the subject the name ELIZA rarely gets mentioned in video essays or in any for of media tasked to explain how to internet we experience today came to be.

Invented as a pattern-maching chatterbox, ELIZA had no sense of the words it regurgitated back to the people in the other side of the monitor, not it didn't understood any context. When equipped with its DOCTOR script it would conduct robotic theraphies in form of asking convenient questions to delve deeper. Doing it mainly by reversing the sentence structure and referring to keywords.
