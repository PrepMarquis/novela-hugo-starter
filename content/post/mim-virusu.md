There is a breakthrough in the field of NLP. Despite of its familliarity with the subject the name ELIZA rarely gets mentioned in video essays or in any for of media tasked to explain how to internet we experience today came to be.

Invented as a pattern-maching chatterbox, ELIZA had no sense of the words it regurgitated back to the people in the other side of the monitor, not it didn't understood any context. When equipped with its DOCTOR script it would conduct robotic theraphies in form of asking convenient questions to delve deeper. Doing it mainly by reversing the sentence structure and referring to keywords.

Oddly, as people interacted with ELIZA they reported a sense of attachment. Something that most of the gamers and devout anime fans have at least experienced one time. Attachment to some sorts of beings that are unfit to socially reciprocate like a video game character you choose to save from death rather than taking an achievement or a parasocial relationship many people establish with the streamer on twitch or imaginary partner on onlyfans thinking that spending funny money on internet based personas may really made them acquainted of sorts? Internet has loads of this especially due to covid-19. Although this aspect and underlying factors may have already become the main force of destruction of the best parts of the internet and people needlessly suffer because of it.

Before everything there was the possibility of nuclear mass destruction this made powerful millitaries to consider a distributed network of processing power. Booming tech scene introduced terminal and personal computers to universities and big corporations and suddenly the www was rolling.

But the early models offered easy, unrestricted access to simply designed distributed fronts, like university pages etc. If you know basic html css you can easily guess the sites in the old web was complex enough to be described as a canvas painting. You laid out the components in html and painted them in css that was all, superficially.
