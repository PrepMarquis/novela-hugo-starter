Hey, are you a web developer? Fine, please make sure to add an "apply with LinkedIn" or import your CV selection whenever you decide to create yet another job portal.

If you are like me, studying for a degree that is without relevant experience, worthless. Eventually you'd find yourself searching for an internship. Some schools have it as a requirement. Whatever it may be here are some takeaways from my experience.

Unless you are working in retail, or your career resembles a retail item (fast consumption, much needed, versatile, almost universal etc.) you, reaching out to a complete stranger - hiring manager- **won't initiate a conversation by itself**. You are at face value just another task to be dealt with. 

**Don't juggle responsibilities**

**Automate**

**Know when it pays to be genuine**

**Case of nepotism**

**University > work**

**Don't be hard on yourself**
