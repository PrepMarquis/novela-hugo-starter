Hey, are you a web developer? Fine, please make sure to add an "apply with LinkedIn" or import your CV selection whenever you decide to create yet another job portal.

If you are like me, studying for a degree that is without relevant experience, worthless. Eventually you'd find yourself searching for an internship. Some schools have it as a requirement. Whatever it may be here are some takeaways from my experience.

**Follow-up to get feedback**

Unless you are working in retail, or your career resembles a retail item (fast consumption, much needed, versatile, almost universal etc.) you, reaching out to a complete stranger - hiring manager- **won't initiate a conversation by itself**. You are at face value just another task to be dealt with.

A plethora of reasons might have led to them not considering you; generally entry-low level applications are ghosted when there is no fit. This inevitably leads to you doubting your talent and fit factor in workplace.

**Don't juggle responsibilities**

**Automate**

Companies do that all the time. They get CVs, feed them into ATS algorithms, review and send out results, conduct interviews. More or less all automated. So why don't you? Grab a copy of airtable's [job huting templates](https://airtable.com/templates/education/expvtfBrVBr0jxcwE/student-job-search), sign up for [startup.jobs](https://startup.jobs)'s email alerts etc. This will save you a lot of time and makes sure that you don't allow opportunities to fall down in cracks.

**Know when it pays to be genuine**

Yep! just be yourself in job interviews! Well, not everytime. You see in 2019 and a small portion of 2020. I've always got similar results in personality tests, formal and informal, following that year where I got my first real responsibility of being a lead PM at a project; the way I approach jobs and people suddenly started to change, nowadays that tests gives out marginally different results that my 2019 version might not even believe.

So, dress for the job you want not the one you have. In some cases your attitude and personality can heavilty effect the outcomes (e.g. sales) that case reflecting your before-self 100% might not be the best strategy to win what is at stake. That is not to say to veil your true personality of course, but think about every early job and internship offer as a way to mold yourself a more complete set. Being open to opportunities and connecting bits of your true self to what the job requires is key.

**Case of nepotism**

**University > work**

**Irrelevant = nonexistent**

**Don't be hard on yourself**
