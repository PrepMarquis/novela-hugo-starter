Hey, are you a web developer? Fine, please make sure to add an "apply with LinkedIn" or import your CV selection whenever you decide to create yet another job portal.

If you are like me, studying for a degree that is without relevant experience, worthless. Eventually you'd find yourself searching for an internship. Some schools have it as a requirement. Whatever it may be here are some takeaways from my experience.

**Follow-up to get feedback**

Unless you are working in retail, or your career resembles a retail item (fast consumption, much needed, versatile, almost universal etc.) you, reaching out to a complete stranger - hiring manager- **won't initiate a conversation by itself**. You are at face value just another task to be dealt with.

A plethora of reasons might have led to them not considering you; generally entry-low level applications are ghosted when there is no fit. This inevitably leads to you doubting your talent and fit factor in workplace.

**Don't juggle responsibilities**

**Automate**

Companies do that all the time. They get CVs, feed them into ATS algorithms, review and send out results, conduct interviews. More or less all automated. So why don't you? Grab a copy of airtable's [job huting templates](https://airtable.com/templates/education/expvtfBrVBr0jxcwE/student-job-search), sign up for [startup.jobs](https://startup.jobs)'s email alerts etc. This will save you a lot of time and makes sure that you don't allow opportunities to fall down in cracks.

**Know when it pays to be genuine**

Yep! be yourself! Well, not everytime. 

**Case of nepotism**

**University > work**

**Don't be hard on yourself**
