For me, there are two types of businesses. You either try to get people in, or you try to get them out. Running any type of internet business and mass religions can be an example for both, respectively.

Though those two can diverge in uncanny ways. When you overpromise, overexcite, fiddle with new and unproven concepts and amp up your marketing more than your capacity to deliver something meaninful. You can, at least for a short period, make an internet business that tries to get people out. Why do they get people out? Because every other user increases their operational costs and asks unnecessary questions.
