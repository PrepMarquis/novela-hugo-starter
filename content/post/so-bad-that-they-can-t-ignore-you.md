**For me, there are two types of businesses.** You either try to get people in, or you try to get them out. Running any type of internet business and mass religions can be an example for both, respectively.

Though those two can diverge in uncanny ways. When you overpromise, overexcite, fiddle with new and unproven concepts and amp up your marketing more than your capacity to deliver something meaninful. You can, at least for a short period, make an internet business that tries to get people out. Why do they get people out? Because every other user increases their operational costs and asks unnecessary questions.

Purpose of this piece is to outline the missteps I personally took in my first year of running a startup program. I highly doubt that people would read this piece (or others in that regard) and find something influential in them

**This is a people's business**

I cannot stress this enough. We started not as a startup program but a series of programming sprints and ideathons. What came out of it was a catch-all startup program that was overpromising. A lot of people came to us asking questions 

**Hard to iterate**

With every broken interaction, a mismanagement or communicative error you lose a boundary or trust. You can't just start from scratch and figure out the way to run your program along the way

**Avoid hunting with trolls**

Because this is a people's business. You cannot afford to be open to anyone. This is a simple rule, really you can't effectively automate a startup program in its core. Define a type of people and pair them with your cause. Get a type of people and make them your people.

**Partners are only meaningful if they are... well... "partners"**

We have 180 of them. Though 

**Do not overpromise**

**It's about them**

**Do your own thing**

You might have a leadership at the top. Bear with them at the minimum for your own sake. Most of the things I've done was unwarranted and they turned out to save the day. Follow the best practices, value experience, get good mentors and do your own thing.
